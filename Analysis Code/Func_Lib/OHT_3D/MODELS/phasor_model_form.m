function [A_div,A_omegamod,b_bccoeff] = phasor_model_form(K,Ss,xb,yb,zb,bdry_types,varargin)

% phasor_model_form: Low-level function which assembles the linear algebra
% problem for the steady-periodic groundwater flow equation in 3D on a
% finite-difference-type grid with a rectangular prism as boundary.
% Boundary conditions of constant head or no flux may be applied at each of
% the 6 surrounding boundaries, but must be constant across each face of
% the rectangular prism.
%
% [A_div,A_omegamod,b_bccoeff] = phasor_model_form(K,Ss,xb,yb,zb,bdry_types)
%   OUTPUTS:
%       A_div - (num_cells x num_cells) "Stiffness" matrix for the system,
%       physically representing flows out of each given cell for a particular
%       set of boundary types
%       A_omegamod - (num_cells x num_cells) Diagonal matrix used to modify
%       the system for a particular oscillation frequency (discussed in
%       further detail below)
%       b_bccoeff - (num_cells x 6) Matrix used to calculate boundary
%       contribution to b matrix, when given head values at each of the 6
%       boundaries (low x, high x, low y, high y, low z, high z)
%
% To use these variables to solve a problem with a given source term
% operating at a given angular frequency (omega), one solves the equation:
%
%              (A_div + A_omegamod*1i*omega)*Phi = (inflow_vec +
%              b_bccoeff*bdry_vals)
%
% where inflow_vec is the external phasor flux into each cell (positive
% inflow_vec = source) as reshaped into a flow vector with standard
% meshgrid mapping, bdry_vals is a 6 x 1 vector of the boundary head values
% (note, if any boundary is no-flux, the corresponding values will not be
% used), and omega is the angular frequency of the test
%
% ***Notes:***
%   1) The unknowns in the 3D grid are mapped to a vector using the
% standard method returned by meshgrid, i.e. phi =
% reshape(phi_grid,num_cells,1), such that phi starts in the lower
% South-west corner of the grid and increments through y first, then
% through x, then through z.
%   2) This code can also be used to solve 2D problems by setting the 3rd
% dimension to have one layer with no flux boundaries on either side.
%   3) This code uses a block-centered setup where inter-block conductances
% are calculated assuming K_1 up to a cell boundary and K_2 after that cell
% boundary, similar to MODFLOW. This results in inter-block conductances
% that are a function of geometric averages of neighboring blocks' K values.
%
% Syntax: [A_div,A_omegamod,b_bccoeff] =
% phasor_model_form(K,Ss,xb,yb,zb,bdry_types)
% where:
%   -[A_div,A_omegamod,b_bccoeff] are the matrices used in the problem
%   solution, as discussed above
%   -K is the matrix of hydraulic conductivity values in the cells of the
%   model, a (num_y x num_x x num_z) matrix, as would be produced from
%   meshgridding the cell centers
%   -Ss is the matrix of Specific storage values in the cells of the model,
%   a (num_y x num_x x num_z) matrix, as would be produced from
%   meshgridding the cell centers.
%   -xb is a ((num_x + 1) x 1) monotonically increasing
%   vector containing the positions of cell boundaries along the x
%   dimension.
%   -yb and zb are similar vectors to xb, but for the y and z dimensions,
%   respectively
%   -bdry_types is a 6 x 1 vector that defines the boundary condition
%   types. If an element of bdry_types is 1, it means that that boundary is
%   "constant head" type, if it is 0, it is treated as a "no flux"
%   boundary. More complex boundary conditions include a leakance boundary
%   condition (bdry_type = 2), and a water table boundary condition
%   (bdry_type = 3). The water table boundary condition may only be
%   implemented for the last (uppermost z) boundary.
%   bdry_types = [ bdry at smallest x;
%                  bdry at largest x;
%                  bdry at smallest y;
%                  bdry at largest y;
%                  bdry at smallest z; 
%                  bdry at largest z; ]
%
% The problem dimension to be solved is num_cells, where num_cells = num_x
% * num_y * num_z. Note num_x, num_y, and num_z are the number of CELLS in
% each dimension, which is one less than the number of boundaries in each
% dimension.
%
% Code based off of a similar setup for steady-state pumping tests (Michael
% Cardiff 7/2010) and modified to extend and make more efficient for
% steady-periodic pumping tests, along with additional cleanup (Michael
% Cardiff, 6/2014, 1/2015, 1/2016)
