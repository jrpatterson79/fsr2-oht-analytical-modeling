function [Kfield] = image2field(image,blackvalue, whitevalue)

%image2field: Reads a 24-bit bitmap image file and converts the results to
%a  field with minimum and maximum specified by the user. Dimensions of the
%field will match the dimensions of the original image. This program
%combines all RGB color channels, effectively resulting in the brightness
%(black to white) value being used for mapping each pixel
%   [Kfield] = image2field(image,blackvalue, whitevalue)
%   where:
%       -image is a text string with the name of the image (must be in the
%       current directory)
%       -blackvalue is the value to be assigned to the cells which are
%       black
%       -whitevalue is the value to be assigned to the cells that are
%       white. All values between whitevalue and blackvalue are
%       interpolated linearly.

%Values are loaded as integers. This converts everything to normal real
%numbers
