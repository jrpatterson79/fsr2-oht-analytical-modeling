function PHIbar_uc = hyder(p,params,testconstants)

%hyder: Program to find the Laplace-transformed normalized source well
%response to a slug injection, as described in Malama et al 2010 "Modeling
%slug tests in unconfined aquifers taking into account source well skin and
%inertial effects". This code calculates the value PHIbar_uc(p) as
%described in the above paper. The solution must be back-converted using
%the inverse laplace transform as used by the program dehoog2.
%
%Usage:
%[PHIbar_uc] = hyder(p,params,testconstants);
%where:
%   -p (scalar) is the Laplace transform parameter
%   -params (6 x 1) is a vector of aquifer parameters to be tried for
%     test-fitting. params should be formatted as follows:
%     params = [ln(Kr2) ln(Kz2) ln(Ss2) ln(Kr1) ln(Kz1) ln(Ss1)] where zone
%     2 is the main aquifer and zone 1 is the wellbore skin.
%   -testconstants (6 x 1) is a vector of constants that apply to the given
%     test. testconstants should be formatted as follows:
%     testconstants = [l d r_w r_sk r_c B]
